# Design and Implementation of a WebAssembly-based Programming Language

WebAssembly (WASM) has become an essential target for programming languages. However, many existing compilers treat it similarly to machine-level assembly, often producing bloated and inefficient bytecode.

This thesis introduces a programming language specifically designed for WebAssembly, optimized to take full advantage of WASM's features and ecosystem standards like the Wasm Interface Types (WIT) standard. The goal is to offer robust tooling support, including code highlighting and a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation, while simplifying debugging by supporting both text and binary WASM formats.

To demonstrate its effectiveness, I will present an example project that showcases the languageâ€™s features and illustrates its practical use in web development workflows.
