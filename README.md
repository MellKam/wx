# Web Assembly Executable Language (WX)

This is a project created as my thesis for my bachelor's degree to explore the possibilities of WASM and better play with building a full blown compiler. It is still in very early stage, so I don't guarantee anything will work at all. 

## Design Philosophy

The main goal of this language is to simplify the writing of WASM modules and make the language be the more high level reflection of the underlying WASM specification. Ideally, the language should teach you how WASM works but keep the convenience of a high level language. The syntax is inspired by Rust, Zig and Typescript.
